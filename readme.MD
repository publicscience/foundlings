# Foundlings

I seriously don't even have a consise description of this yet, but for now, Foundlings is a larger project consisting of sound-related applications, including a location-based field recorder app, mobile listening kits (based on Good Vibrations), resources, workshops and tours.

More to come as the project is fleshed out more...
